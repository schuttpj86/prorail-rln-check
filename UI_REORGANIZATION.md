# UI Reorganization - Left Panel Route Management

## Overview
Complete reorganization of the ProRail Cable Route Evaluator UI to consolidate all route management into the left control panel, removing the drawing tools from the top-right map area and creating a cleaner, more intuitive interface.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Drawing Tools Widget from Map
**Before:** Drawing tools appeared as an expandable widget in the top-right corner of the map
**After:** Only the Layer List widget remains in the top-right corner

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner map interface
- Less visual clutter
- Layer management is the only map overlay control

### 2. ✅ Consolidated Drawing Controls in Left Panel
**Location:** Top of the left control panel under "New Route" section

**Controls:**
- **Draw New Route** button - Primary action to start drawing
- **Cancel** button - Cancel current drawing operation
- **Drawing Status** - Real-time feedback on drawing state

**Removed:**
- Snapping controls (can be re-added later if needed)
- Tolerance slider
- Separate expand widget

### 3. ✅ Redesigned Route Cards - Minimal & Clean
**New Layout:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ■ Route Name                 [Click to Select]
│ 
│   Length: 5.42 km
│   Points: 15
│   Created: 07-10-25 14:30
│   
│   Description:
│   [Editable text area]
│   
│   [✏️ Edit] [🎨] [🗑️]
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Features:**
- **Color Indicator (■)**: 20x20px square showing route trace color
- **Route Name**: Bold, clickable header - click anywhere to select/zoom
- **Minimal Info Grid**: Length, points, creation date in compact grid
- **Editable Description**: Multi-line textarea for notes/comments
- **Three Main Actions**:
  - ✏️ **Edit** - Opens edit menu with advanced options
  - 🎨 **Color** - Quick access to color picker
  - 🗑️ **Delete** - Remove route with confirmation

### 4. ✅ Collapsible Edit Menu
**Trigger:** Click the "Edit" button on any route card

**Edit Options Menu:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ EDIT OPTIONS
│ 
│ [✏️ Edit Waypoints]
│ [⬅️ Extend from Start]
│ [➡️ Extend from End]
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Behavior:**
- Slides down with smooth animation
- Only one menu open at a time (auto-closes others)
- Click Edit button again to close
- Closes automatically when operation starts

### 5. ✅ Route Information Display
