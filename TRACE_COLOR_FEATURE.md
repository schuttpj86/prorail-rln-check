# Trace Color Indicator Feature

## Overview
Added a visual trace color indicator system that allows users to differentiate between multiple cable routes on the map by assigning custom colors to each route.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Visual Trace Indicator in Route Cards
- **Color Square**: Each route card now displays a 24x24px colored square that matches the route's trace color on the map
- **Position**: Located at the top-left of each route card, next to the route name
- **Visual Design**: 
  - Rounded corners (4px border radius)
  - Dark border (2px solid #333) for visibility against any background
  - Clickable with visual feedback (cursor changes to pointer)

### 2. Interactive Color Selection
- **Click to Change**: Users can click the color indicator square to open a color picker dialog
- **Color Palette**: 10 predefined colors optimized for map visibility:
  - Red (#ff0000) - Default
  - Blue (#0066ff)
  - Green (#00cc00)
  - Orange (#ff8800)
  - Purple (#9933ff)
  - Yellow (#ffcc00)
  - Pink (#ff00ff)
  - Cyan (#00ffff)
  - Brown (#996633)
  - Gray (#808080)

### 3. Color Picker Dialog
- **Modal Interface**: Clean, centered modal overlay with semi-transparent background
- **Large Color Swatches**: 40x40px clickable color squares with tooltips showing color names
- **Easy Selection**: Single click to select a color
- **Keyboard Support**: ESC key or clicking outside closes the dialog
- **Cancel Button**: Explicit option to close without making changes

### 4. Real-Time Map Updates
- **Instant Feedback**: Route color updates immediately on both the map and in the route card
- **Line Width Preservation**: Active routes remain thicker (8px) while inactive routes stay thinner (4px)
- **Color Persistence**: Selected colors are stored with the route data

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
Each route now includes a `color` property:
```javascript
{
  id: "route-1234",
  name: "Route 1",
  length: 5420.5,
  points: 15,
  created: "2025-10-07T...",
  color: "#ff0000"  // NEW: Hex color value
}
```

### Key Methods Added

#### `EnhancedDrawingManager.updateRouteColor(routeId, hexColor)`
- Converts hex color to RGB array for ArcGIS symbols
- Updates the route's graphic symbol with the new color
- Preserves line width based on active/inactive state
- Stores color in route data
- Triggers `onRouteUpdated` callback

#### `EnhancedDrawingManager.getRoute(routeId)`
- Simple getter to retrieve route data including color
- Used by UI to display current route color

#### `window.changeRouteColor(routeId)`
- Creates modal color picker dialog
- Handles color selection events
- Updates both map and UI elements
- Manages dialog lifecycle

### UI Updates

#### `addRouteToList(routeData)`
- Extracts current route color (defaults to red)
- Creates trace indicator div with inline styles
- Adds click handler to open color picker
- Positions indicator next to route name

#### `updateRouteInList(routeData)`
- Updates trace indicator color when route is modified
- Preserves indicator during route editing operations

## User Workflow

1. **Create Route**: New routes automatically get a red trace color
2. **View Routes**: Each route card shows its color in the indicator square
3. **Change Color**: 
   - Click the colored square
   - Select a new color from the palette
   - Color updates instantly on map and in card
4. **Distinguish Routes**: Use different colors to visually separate multiple routes on the map

## Benefits

### For Single Routes
- **Visual Confirmation**: Color indicator confirms which route is displayed
- **Status at a Glance**: Quickly identify the route by its color

### For Multiple Routes
- **Easy Differentiation**: Assign unique colors to each route for clarity
- **Quick Identification**: Find specific routes by color both on map and in list
- **Professional Presentation**: Color-coded routes look organized and professional

## Example Use Cases

1. **Comparing Alternatives**: 
   - Route 1 (Red): Direct path through station area
   - Route 2 (Blue): Alternative avoiding high-traffic zones
   - Route 3 (Green): Compliant route with minimal EMC impact

2. **Project Phases**:
   - Phase 1 routes: Red, Orange, Yellow (warm colors)
   - Phase 2 routes: Blue, Cyan, Purple (cool colors)

3. **Compliance Status** (Future Enhancement):
   - Compliant routes: Green, Cyan
   - Non-compliant routes: Red, Orange
   - Under review: Yellow, Gray

## Technical Notes

### Color Format
- **Input**: Hex color strings (e.g., "#ff0000")
- **Storage**: Hex format in route data
- **Rendering**: Converted to RGB arrays [r, g, b, alpha] for ArcGIS symbols

### Default Behavior
- New routes default to red (#ff0000)
- Active (selected) routes display at 8px width
- Inactive routes display at 4px width
- Color is preserved when toggling between active/inactive states

### Future Enhancements
1. **Custom Color Picker**: Allow users to input any hex color
2. **Color Templates**: Save favorite color combinations
3. **Auto-Assign Colors**: Automatically assign different colors to new routes
4. **Compliance Colors**: Auto-set colors based on EMC evaluation results
5. **Export Color Mapping**: Include color legend in route reports

## Files Modified

1. **src/main.js**
   - Updated `addRouteToList()` to include trace indicator
   - Updated `updateRouteInList()` to maintain color indicator
   - Added `window.changeRouteColor()` global function
   - Added color picker modal implementation

2. **src/utils/EnhancedDrawingManager.js**
   - Added `updateRouteColor()` method
   - Added `getRoute()` helper method
   - Updated route creation to include default color
   - Enhanced color management in route data structure

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Route cards display color indicator
- [x] Clicking indicator opens color picker
- [x] Selecting color updates map trace
- [x] Selecting color updates card indicator
- [x] Dialog closes properly (click, cancel, ESC)
- [x] Colors persist across route edits
- [x] Multiple routes can have different colors
- [x] Active route maintains thicker line width

## Deployment Status

âœ… Feature is complete and ready for testing
ðŸš€ Development server running on port 3001

## Next Steps

1. Test with multiple routes to verify color differentiation
2. Gather user feedback on color palette selection
3. Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for quick color assignment
4. Plan integration with EMC compliance status (auto-color based on evaluation)
