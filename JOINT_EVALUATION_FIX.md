# Joint Evaluation Fix

## Problem

When placing joints on a route:
1. Joint would be added successfully ✅
2. Joint distance would be calculated ✅ 
3. But the evaluation would show "Pending" status ⏳
4. Multiple evaluations would run (3x) causing confusion
5. The UI wouldn't update to show the joint evaluation results

## Root Causes

### 1. **No Automatic Re-Evaluation After Joint Placement**
When a joint was added:
- The `minJointDistanceMeters` metadata was updated
- But NO evaluation was triggered
- The rule stayed in "pending" state waiting for evaluation

### 2. **Multiple Evaluation Triggers**
When deactivating joint marking mode:
- Multiple code paths were triggering evaluations
- No debouncing of UI renders
- Resulted in 3x evaluations running simultaneously

### 3. **UI Render Flooding**
`renderEvaluationReports()` was being called from multiple places:
- During evaluation start
- After evaluation complete
- From `showRouteDetails()`
- From `expandEvaluationDetails()`
- Each call would re-render the entire Results panel

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Evaluation After Joint Placement** ✅

```javascript
// After adding joint and updating metadata
const minDistance = getMinimumJointToTrackDistance(routeId);
if (minDistance !== null) {
  route.metadata.minJointDistanceMeters = minDistance;
  
  // Trigger re-evaluation after updating joint distance
  setTimeout(() => {
    evaluateRouteCompliance(routeId);
  }, 100);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Joint evaluation updates immediately after placement
- User sees real-time compliance status
- No manual "Re-run evaluation" needed

### 2. **Enhanced Logging for Debugging** 📊

```javascript
console.log(`✅ EMC evaluation complete for route ${routeId}`, result.summary);
console.log(`   📊 Status: ${result.summary?.status}`);
console.log(`   ✅ Pass: ${result.summary?.passCount}, ❌ Fail: ${result.summary?.failCount}, ⏳ Pending: ${result.summary?.pendingCount}`);

// Log any pending rules
if (result.rules) {
  const pendingRules = result.rules.filter(r => r.status === 'not_evaluated' || r.status === 'pending');
  if (pendingRules.length > 0) {
    console.log(`   ⏳ Pending rules:`, pendingRules.map(r => r.title).join(', '));
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to debug evaluation status
- Can see exactly which rules are pending
- Clear visibility into pass/fail counts

### 3. **Debounced UI Rendering** ⚡

```javascript
// Debounce the render to prevent multiple quick re-renders
clearTimeout(window._renderDebounceTimer);
window._renderDebounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {
  renderEvaluationReports(routeId);
}, 50);
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents render flooding
- Smoves UI updates
- Reduces unnecessary re-renders from multiple calls

### 4. **Removed Redundant Evaluation Triggers** 🧹

In `deactivateJointMarking()`:
```javascript
// Note: Re-evaluation already triggered when joints are added, no need to trigger again here
```

In `onRouteUpdated()`:
```javascript
// Note: Don't call showRouteDetails here - the auto-evaluation will update the UI
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates duplicate evaluations
- Clearer flow of when evaluations occur
- Better performance

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
1. User places joint ⚡
2. Joint appears on map
3. UI still shows "Pending 1" ⏳
4. User manually clicks "Re-run evaluation"
5. Multiple evaluations run (3x) 
6. UI might not update properly
7. Confusion about actual status ❓

### After:
1. User places joint ⚡
2. Joint appears on map ✅
3. **Automatic evaluation starts** 🔄
4. UI shows "Running EMC checks..."
5. **Evaluation completes ONCE** ✅
6. **UI updates with joint evaluation results** 📊
7. Clear pass/fail status for joint distance rule 🎯

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Joint Near Track (< 31m)
1. Create a route that passes close to railway tracks
2. Click "Mark Joints/Earthing"
3. Place a joint on the route
4. ✅ **Expected:** Evaluation runs automatically
5. ✅ **Expected:** UI shows "Fail" with red X
6. ✅ **Expected:** Message shows actual distance (e.g., "< 31m")

### Test Case 2: Joint Far from Track (> 31m)
1. Create a route far from railway tracks  
2. Place a joint on the route
3. ✅ **Expected:** Evaluation runs automatically
4. ✅ **Expected:** UI shows "Pass" with green checkmark
5. ✅ **Expected:** Message shows "Joints located XX.X m from track"

### Test Case 3: Multiple Joints
1. Place multiple joints on a route
2. ✅ **Expected:** Evaluation updates after each joint
3. ✅ **Expected:** Minimum distance updates correctly
4. ✅ **Expected:** Only ONE evaluation runs per joint

### Test Case 4: Route Far from All Tracks
1. Create a route > 31m from all tracks
2. ✅ **Expected:** Joint rule shows automatic pass
3. ✅ **Expected:** Message: "Entire route is XX.X m from tracks - joints can be placed anywhere"

## Technical Notes

- The 100ms delay in setTimeout allows the joint graphic to be added and metadata to settle
- The 50ms debounce on renders is short enough to feel instant but prevents flooding
- The duplicate prevention check happens at the START of evaluation, not after
- Joint distance is calculated using the jointManager utility
- The evaluation rule checks `ctx.metadata.minJointDistanceMeters`
