# UI Reorganization - Complete ✅

## Overview
Reorganized the user interface to improve usability and screen space utilization while maintaining all existing functionality.

---

## Changes Made

### 1️⃣ **Drawing Controls → Map Widget**

**Before:**
- Drawing controls were in the left panel
- Took up vertical space in the Routes panel
- Required scrolling to see routes

**After:**
- **Floating widget** in top-right corner of map (near zoom controls)
- Compact design with icons (➕ Draw, ✖ Cancel)
- Minimal footprint: ~220-280px wide
- Status updates shown in widget
- Always visible, doesn't interfere with map navigation

**Location:** Top-right of map, positioned at `top: 20px; right: 20px`

---

### 2️⃣ **Panel Layout - Left vs Right**

**Before:**
```
[Routes Panel] [Map] [Results Panel]
```

**After:** *(Same structure, but cleaner)*
```
[Routes Panel] [Map with Widget] [Results Panel]
       ↓              ↓                    ↓
   Focused        Drawing UI         Evaluation
   on routes      overlays map        reports
```

**Routes Panel (Left):**
- Dedicated to route management
- More vertical space for route cards
- Removed "New Route" section (moved to map)
- Clean, focused interface

**Results Panel (Right):**
- Unchanged position
- Shows EMC evaluation results
- Maintains existing expand/collapse functionality

---

### 3️⃣ **Collapsible Route Cards**

**New Feature:** Route cards now collapse/expand like evaluation reports

**Header Click Action:**
- Click route header → Toggle collapse/expand
- Icon changes: ▼ (expanded) ↔ ▶ (collapsed)
- Smooth transition animation

**When Collapsed:**
- Shows: Route name, color indicator, collapse icon
- Hides: Details, description, EMC inputs, buttons

**When Expanded:**
- Shows everything (default state)

**Benefits:**
- Manage many routes without scrolling
- Quick overview of all routes
- Focus on specific routes when needed
