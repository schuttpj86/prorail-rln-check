## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: EMC Compliance

### Critical Layer for RLN00398 Compliance

The **🚦 Train Protection System** layer is **essential** for EMC analysis:

**What it contains:**
- Signals (Seinen)
- Signal boards (Seinborden)
- Balises (train detection/positioning)
- Cabinets (control equipment)

**Why it matters:**
- These components are **highly sensitive to electromagnetic interference (EMI)**
- High-voltage cables can cause interference
- RLN00398 standard requires safe distances
- **Failure to maintain clearances = safety hazard**

**Recommended workflow:**
1. ✅ Draw your proposed cable route
2. ✅ Enable "🚦 Train Protection System" layer
3. ✅ Zoom to your cable route
4. ✅ Identify all train protection equipment within 50m
5. ✅ Calculate required clearances per RLN00398
6. ✅ Adjust route if needed or plan for shielding

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Performance Tips
1. **Start with basic layers** - Don't enable everything at once
2. **Zoom in for detail layers** - Cables, signals only show at close zoom
3. **Collapse unused groups** - Keeps interface clean
4. **Toggle off layers** when not needed - Improves map responsiveness

### Data Exploration Tips
1. **Click features** to see all attributes in pop-ups
2. **Layer transparency** - Groups allow adjusting visibility
3. **Legend available** - Expand layers to see legend symbology
4. **Scale-dependent layers** - Some layers disappear when zoomed out

### EMC Analysis Tips
1. **Always check Train Protection layer** before finalizing routes
2. **Document all equipment** within 50m of cable route
3. **Use screenshots** with layers visible for reports
4. **Cross-reference** multiple layers for comprehensive analysis

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential next steps to enhance this integration:

### 1. Custom Symbology
- Define custom renderers for each layer type
- Color-code by EMI sensitivity (red = critical, yellow = caution, green = safe)
- Use symbols that match ProRail standards

### 2. EMC Buffer Analysis
- Auto-calculate safety buffers around train protection equipment
- Visual buffer zones (e.g., 10m, 25m, 50m circles)
- Automatic clash detection when cable routes enter buffer zones

### 3. Advanced Filtering
- Filter signals by type (light signals vs. mechanical)
- Filter cables by voltage level
- Filter buildings by function

### 4. Measurement Tools
- Distance measurement from cable route to nearest signal
- Batch measurement to all EMI-sensitive equipment
- Clearance validation against RLN00398 requirements

### 5. Reporting
- Auto-generate EMC compliance reports
- List all equipment within specified distance
- Export to PDF/Excel with distances and coordinates

### 6. Layer Sublayer Access
- Some FeatureServers have many sublayers
- Could expose individual sublayers within each group
- More granular control (e.g., separate "Light Signals" from "Mechanical Signals")
