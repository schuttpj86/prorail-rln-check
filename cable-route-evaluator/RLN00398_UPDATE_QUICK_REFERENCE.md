# RLN00398 V002 Update - Quick Reference Guide

## üéØ TL;DR - What You Need to Know

Your Cable Route Evaluator is based on the **2013 version** of ProRail's EMC standard.  
ProRail released an **updated 2020 version** with critical changes.

**Bottom Line:** Some evaluation thresholds are outdated, and new precision features are available.

## üîç The 4 Key Changes Explained

### 1. B5 Criterion: 50Hz in DC Traction (**MOST CRITICAL**)

**What changed:**
- **OLD (2013):** Max 50Hz component: 7V (continuous) / 25V (short circuit)
- **NEW (2020):** Max 50Hz component: **16V (continuous) / 40V (short circuit)**

**Why it matters:**
- Limits are now **2.3x more permissive**
- Current app either:
  - Uses old (too strict) limits ‚Üí unnecessarily rejects valid routes
  - OR doesn't check this at all ‚Üí missing safety check

**Status in your app:**
- ‚ùå **NOT FOUND** - This evaluation rule appears to be missing entirely

**What needs to happen:**
- Add new evaluation rule with V002 thresholds
- OR verify if this is implemented somewhere I missed

---

### 2. Appendix 2: Length-Based Track Circuit Immunity (**ACCURACY UPGRADE**)

**What changed:**
- **OLD (2013):** Generic thresholds (20V / 58A) for ALL track circuits
- **NEW (2020):** Detailed tables with **length-specific** immunity values

**Example - Why it matters:**

| Track Circuit Length | Generic Threshold (Old) | Precise Threshold (New, OV 231.112-4) | Difference |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------|
| 50m | 20V | 61.4V | **3x more permissive** |
| 200m | 20V | 34.1V | 1.7x more permissive |
| 600m | 20V | 23.8V | Slightly more permissive |

**Status in your app:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses generic 20V for everything
- Could be much more accurate with length-based tables

**What needs to happen:**
- Implement Appendix 2 lookup tables
- Add optional user input for track circuit length/type
- Future: Auto-detect from ProRail GIS data

---

### 3. T4: Homopolar Current Exception (**LOGIC REFINEMENT**)

**What changed:**
- **OLD (2013):** Always assume 10% homopolar current in calculations
- **NEW (2020):** Can be **skipped if physically impossible** (e.g., ungrounded network topology)

**Why it matters:**
- Some high-voltage networks have topologies that make homopolar current impossible
- Old approach was overly conservative for these cases
- New approach: let user confirm if this applies

**Status in your app:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not explicitly modeled (app uses geometric proximity only)

**What needs to happen:**
- Add checkbox: "Consider 10% Homopolar Current (Asymmetry)"
- Default: checked (conservative)
- User can uncheck if network topology makes it impossible

---

### 4. Document Version References (**COMPLIANCE**)

**What changed:**
- All references should specify **version and date**

**Status in your app:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All say "RLN00398" without version

**What needs to happen:**
- Find/replace: "RLN00398" ‚Üí "RLN00398, Version 002 (01-12-2020)"
- Update in code, translations, docs, and reports

## üö¶ Recommended Action Plan

### **Option 1: Quick Compliance Fix (1 week)**
‚úÖ Implement B5 with correct V002 thresholds  
‚úÖ Update all document references  
‚è∏Ô∏è Defer Appendix 2 and T4 toggle to later

**Best for:** Immediate compliance, minimal disruption

---

### **Option 2: Comprehensive Update (3-4 weeks)**
‚úÖ Implement B5 with V002 thresholds  
‚úÖ Add Appendix 2 tables (manual input mode)  
‚úÖ Add T4 homopolar current toggle  
‚úÖ Update all document references  

**Best for:** Full accuracy and feature parity with V002

---

### **Option 3: Incremental Rollout (4-6 weeks)**
‚úÖ Week 1: B5 + document updates ‚Üí Test & validate  
‚úÖ Week 2: T4 toggle ‚Üí Test & validate  
‚úÖ Week 3-4: Appendix 2 tables ‚Üí Test & validate  

**Best for:** Lowest risk, thorough testing at each step

## üéì Technical Terms Explained

**B5 Criterion:** Rule about maximum 50Hz voltage component allowed in 1500V DC traction systems

**Homopolar Current:** Unbalanced current flowing through ground (also called "zero-sequence current")

**Track Circuit:** Railway signaling system that detects train presence using electrical current through rails

**Immunity:** How much interference a system can tolerate before malfunctioning

**CM (Common Mode):** Electrical interference affecting all conductors equally relative to ground

**Spoorstroomloop:** Dutch term for "track circuit"

**Enkelbenig:** Dutch for "single-leg" track circuit (more sensitive to interference)

## üí° Why This Matters

**For Engineers:**
- More accurate compliance assessments
- Better optimization of cable routes
- Alignment with latest ProRail requirements

**For Project Timelines:**
- Avoid route rejections due to outdated criteria
- Reduce unnecessary design iterations
- Support faster approval processes

**For Compliance:**
