# Layer Management Changes - Summary

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. Layer List Default State: CLOSED
**File:** `src/main.js`

Changed the layer list panel to start **collapsed** instead of expanded:

```javascript
const layerListExpand = new Expand({
  view: view,
  content: layerList,
  expanded: false, // ✅ Now starts collapsed
  expandTooltip: "Layer List - Toggle ProRail Layers"
});
```

**User Experience:**
- Application loads with a clean interface
- Layer list icon appears in top-right corner
- Click icon to expand/collapse the layer list

---

### 2. Layer Categorization with Groups
**File:** `src/main.js`

Layers are now organized into **collapsible groups** by dataset:

```
Layer List (in top-right)
├── 🚂 ProRail Base Infrastructure [GROUP]
│   ├── 🚂 Railway Tracks (Spoorbaanhartlijn)
│   ├── 🛤️ Track Sections (Spoortakdeel)
│   ├── 🚉 Stations
│   ├── 🔀 Switches (Wissel)
│   └── ⚠️ Level Crossings (Overweg)
├── �️ Structures & Buildings [GROUP]
│   └── 🏗️ Structures & Buildings (bridges, viaducts, tunnels, buildings)
├── ⚡ Energy Supply System [GROUP]
│   └── ⚡ Energy Supply System (overhead lines, substations, switching stations)
├── 🚦 Train Protection System [GROUP - EMI SENSITIVE!]
│   └── 🚦 Train Protection System (signals, balises, cabinets)
├── 🔌 Cable Situation [GROUP]
│   └── 🔌 Cable Situation (underground cables, conduits, trenches)
├── 🔧 Other Track Objects [GROUP]
│   └── 🔧 Other Track Objects (service points, lighting, hydrants)
├── 📏 Track Asset Distances [GROUP]
│   └── 📏 Track Asset Distances (platform walls, signals with distances)
└── 📍 Cable Routes (ungrouped - user drawings)
```

**User Experience:**
- Click group name to expand/collapse all layers in that category
- Toggle entire group on/off with group checkbox
- Toggle individual layers within each group
- Each layer shows legend when expanded

---

## 📂 File Changes

### Modified Files:
1. **`src/main.js`**
   - Added `GroupLayer` import
   - Added imports for `technicalRoomsLayers` and `highVoltageLayers`
   - Created separate feature layer arrays for each dataset
   - Organized layers into GroupLayers
   - Changed layer list to start collapsed

### Configuration Files (unchanged - ready for you):
2. **`src/layers/layerConfig.js`**
   - Already has `technicalRoomsLayers` array (commented out examples)
   - Already has `highVoltageLayers` array (commented out examples)
   - Ready to accept new layer configurations

### New Documentation:
3. **`LAYER_ORGANIZATION.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete guide on how to add layers to each category
   - Step-by-step instructions for adding new categories
   - Best practices and configuration reference

---

## 🎯 How to Add New Layers

### Quick Example: Adding Technical Rooms

1. Open `src/layers/layerConfig.js`
2. Uncomment and update the example in `technicalRoomsLayers`:

```javascript
export const technicalRoomsLayers = [
  {
    id: 'technical-rooms',
    url: 'https://your-actual-server.com/arcgis/rest/services/TechRooms/FeatureServer/0',
    title: '🏢 Technical Rooms',
    visible: true,
    // ... configuration
  }
];
```

3. Save and refresh - your layers will automatically appear under "🏢 Technical Rooms" group!

**No changes needed in `main.js`** - the groups are already set up!

## 🎨 Visual Benefits

### Before:
```
Layer List (expanded on startup) ❌
├── 🚂 Railway Tracks (Spoorbaanhartlijn)
├── 🛤️ Track Sections (Spoortakdeel)
├── 🚉 Stations
├── 🔀 Switches (Wissel)
├── ⚠️ Level Crossings (Overweg)
└── 📍 Cable Routes
(All in one flat list - becomes messy with more layers)
```

### After:
```
[Layers icon] (collapsed on startup) ✅

When expanded:
├── 🚂 ProRail Infrastructure ▼
├── 🏢 Technical Rooms ▼
├── ⚡ High Voltage Infrastructure ▼
└── 📍 Cable Routes
(Organized, scalable, professional)
```

---

## 🚀 Ready for Scale

The system now includes **7 comprehensive ProRail datasets**:
- ✅ ProRail Base Infrastructure (5 layers active)
- ✅ Structures & Buildings (bridges, tunnels, buildings)
- ✅ Energy Supply System (overhead lines, substations) 
- ✅ Train Protection System (signals, balises - **EMI sensitive!**)
- ✅ Cable Situation (underground cables, conduits)
- ✅ Other Track Objects (service points, lighting, hydrants)
- ✅ Track Asset Distances (precise positioning data)

Each group is fully configured and ready to use!

---

## 📖 Next Steps

1. **Test the new datasets:**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Open the Layer List (top-right)
   - Expand each group to see the available layers
   - Toggle layers on/off to view different infrastructure

2. **Important for EMC Analysis:**
   - Enable **🚦 Train Protection System** layer when planning cable routes
   - This layer shows EMI-sensitive equipment (signals, balises, cabinets)
   - Critical for RLN00398 compliance!

3. **Explore the data:**
   - Click on features to see pop-up information
   - Zoom in to see detailed layers (cables, signals appear at closer zoom)
   - Use multiple layers together for comprehensive analysis

4. **Read the documentation:**
   - See `PRORAIL_DATASETS.md` for complete dataset reference
   - Includes recommended workflows for EMC analysis
   - Details on each dataset's content and use cases
