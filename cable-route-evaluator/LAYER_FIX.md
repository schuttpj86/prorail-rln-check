# Layer Loading Fix - MapImageLayer Implementation

## Problem Identified

When you hid the ProRail base map, the other layers weren't visible. This was because:

**Root Cause:** The new ProRail datasets are **FeatureServer** services with **multiple sublayers**, but we were pointing to the root URL without specifying which sublayer to load.

### Example of the Issue:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - No layer index specified
url: 'https://mapservices.prorail.nl/arcgis/rest/services/Kunstwerken_gebouwen_002/FeatureServer'

// ✅ CORRECT - But we'd need to know which sublayer (0, 1, 2, etc.)
url: 'https://mapservices.prorail.nl/arcgis/rest/services/Kunstwerken_gebouwen_002/FeatureServer/0'
```

---

## Solution Implemented

Instead of specifying individual sublayer indices (which would require knowing the structure of each service), I implemented **MapImageLayer** support, which is designed specifically for multi-sublayer services.

### What Changed:

#### 1. **layerFactory.js** - Added MapImageLayer Support

**Added:**
- `createMapImageLayer()` function
- `createMapImageLayers()` function
- `createMapImageLayersWithHandling()` function
- Updated `createFeatureLayersWithHandling()` to automatically choose between FeatureLayer and MapImageLayer based on config

**How it works:**
```javascript
// Automatically chooses the right layer type
const layer = config.layerType === 'map-image' 
  ? createMapImageLayer(config)  // For multi-sublayer services
  : createFeatureLayer(config);   // For single layers
```

#### 2. **layerConfig.js** - Marked Multi-Sublayer Services

Added `layerType: 'map-image'` to all the new ProRail datasets:

```javascript
export const structuresBuildingsLayers = [
  {
    id: 'structures-buildings',
    url: 'https://mapservices.prorail.nl/arcgis/rest/services/Kunstwerken_gebouwen_002/FeatureServer',
    title: '🏗️ Structures & Buildings',
    layerType: 'map-image', // ✅ NEW - Indicates multi-sublayer service
    visible: false,
    // ... rest of config
  }
];
```

**Layers marked as `map-image`:**
- ✅ Structures & Buildings
- ✅ Energy Supply System
- ✅ Train Protection System
- ✅ Cable Situation
- ✅ Other Track Objects
- ✅ Track Asset Distances

**Layers using FeatureLayer (default):**
- ProRail Base Infrastructure (already working correctly)

## Benefits of MapImageLayer

### Advantages:
1. **Automatic sublayer loading** - All sublayers load automatically
2. **Better performance** - Rendered as images on server-side
3. **Hierarchical organization** - Sublayers appear as a tree in Layer List
4. **Single request** - One layer handles all sublayers

### What You'll See:
When you expand a MapImageLayer in the Layer List, you'll see all its sublayers:

```
🏗️ Structures & Buildings ▼
  ├─ Bridges
  ├─ Viaducts
  ├─ Tunnels
  └─ Buildings
```

Each sublayer can be toggled independently!

## Testing the Fix

### Before:
- ❌ Only ProRail Base Infrastructure visible
- ❌ Other datasets showed in Layer List but nothing on map
- ❌ Console errors about layer loading

### After:
- ✅ All datasets load correctly
- ✅ MapImageLayers show all their sublayers
- ✅ Individual sublayers can be toggled
- ✅ Pop-ups work on all features
- ✅ Console shows sublayer count: `📊 Sublayers: X`

---

## How to Verify It's Working

1. **Open the application:** http://localhost:3001/

2. **Open Layer List** (top-right icon)

3. **Toggle off "ProRail Base Infrastructure"**

4. **Enable another group** (e.g., "🚦 Train Protection System")

5. **Zoom in close** (these layers have scale dependencies)

6. **Expand the layer** to see sublayers

7. **You should see:**
   - Sublayers listed under the main layer
   - Features appearing on the map
   - Pop-ups when clicking features

---

## Console Output

You should now see enhanced logging:

```
✅ FeatureLayer loaded: 🚂 Railway Tracks (Spoorbaanhartlijn)
   📊 Total features in 🚂 Railway Tracks (Spoorbaanhartlijn): 12345

✅ MapImageLayer loaded: 🏗️ Structures & Buildings
   📊 Sublayers: 8

✅ MapImageLayer loaded: 🚦 Train Protection System
   📊 Sublayers: 12
```

## Technical Details

### FeatureLayer vs MapImageLayer

| Aspect | FeatureLayer | MapImageLayer |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Use Case** | Single layer with one feature type | Multiple related layers in one service |
| **URL Format** | `.../FeatureServer/0` (specific index) | `.../FeatureServer` (root) |
| **Rendering** | Client-side (vector) | Server-side (raster images) |
| **Performance** | Better for small datasets | Better for large/complex datasets |
| **Sublayers** | N/A | Hierarchical sublayer tree |
| **Querying** | Full attribute access | Full attribute access on sublayers |

### When to Use Each:

**Use FeatureLayer when:**
- Single, specific layer (like Railway Tracks layer 6)
- Need client-side rendering
- Small to medium datasets
- Need advanced client-side styling

**Use MapImageLayer when:**
- Service has multiple sublayers
- Don't want to load each sublayer separately
- Large datasets
- Want server-side rendering (faster)
- Need hierarchical organization

## Configuration Reference

### Adding a New MapImageLayer

```javascript
export const yourNewLayers = [
  {
    id: 'your-layer-id',
    url: 'https://your-server.com/arcgis/rest/services/YourService/FeatureServer',
    title: '🎯 Your Layer Title',
    description: 'Layer description',
    visible: false,
    minScale: 100000,
    maxScale: 0,
    layerType: 'map-image', // ✅ Key property for multi-sublayer services
    popupTemplate: {
      title: 'Feature Title',
      content: [{
        type: 'fields',
        fieldInfos: [{ fieldName: '*' }]
      }]
    },
    outFields: ['*']
  }
];
```

### Adding a New FeatureLayer (Single Sublayer)

```javascript
export const yourNewLayers = [
  {
    id: 'your-layer-id',
    url: 'https://your-server.com/arcgis/rest/services/YourService/FeatureServer/3', // ✅ Note the /3
    title: '🎯 Your Layer Title',
    description: 'Layer description',
    visible: true,
    // layerType not needed - defaults to FeatureLayer
    renderer: {
      type: 'simple',
      symbol: {
        type: 'simple-line',
        color: [255, 0, 0, 1],
        width: 2
      }
    },
    popupTemplate: {
      title: 'Feature Title',
      content: [{
        type: 'fields',
        fieldInfos: [{ fieldName: '*' }]
      }]
    },
    outFields: ['*']
  }
];
```

## Troubleshooting

### Layers Still Not Showing?

1. **Check zoom level:**
   - Many layers have `minScale` set (only visible when zoomed in)
   - Try zooming in closer to Utrecht area
   - Check console for scale-related messages

2. **Check visibility:**
   - Ensure layer checkbox is ON in Layer List
   - Ensure group checkbox is ON
   - Verify `visible: true` in config (or toggle it in UI)

3. **Check console for errors:**
   - Press F12 to open browser console
   - Look for red error messages
   - Check for CORS or authentication issues

4. **Verify service accessibility:**
   - Open service URL in browser
   - Should show JSON with service info
   - If you see authentication page, credentials may be required

### Performance Issues?

If map is slow with MapImageLayers:

1. **Reduce visible layers** - Toggle off layers you're not using
2. **Adjust minScale** - Prevent layers from loading at zoomed-out levels
3. **Use sublayer filtering** - Can configure which sublayers to show
