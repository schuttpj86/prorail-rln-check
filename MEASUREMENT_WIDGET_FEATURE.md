# Measurement Widget - Feature Documentation

## Overview
A clean, interactive distance measurement tool has been added to the ProRail Cable Route Evaluator. This widget allows you to quickly check distances on the map without saving them as permanent annotations.

## Features

### ✅ What It Does
- **Click-to-measure**: Click on the map to add measurement points
- **Real-time preview**: See distance as you move your mouse before clicking
- **Segment distances**: Shows distance for each segment between points
- **Total distance**: Displays cumulative distance at the end point
- **Clean formatting**: Uses the same annotation style as your existing distance markers
- **Temporary only**: Measurements don't clutter your saved routes

### 🎨 Visual Design
- **Blue markers**: Small circular points at each measurement location
- **Solid lines**: Blue lines connecting measurement points (darker than preview)
- **Dashed preview**: Light blue dashed line follows your cursor
- **Distance labels**: Clean text labels showing distances in m, cm, or km
- **White halos**: Text has subtle white glow for readability
- **Total label**: Highlighted total distance at the last point

### 📏 Distance Formatting
- **< 1 meter**: Displays in centimeters (e.g., "45.3 cm")
- **1-1000 meters**: Displays in meters (e.g., "234.56 m")
- **> 1000 meters**: Displays in kilometers (e.g., "1.234 km")

## How to Use

### Starting a Measurement
1. Click the **📏 Measure** button in the left panel (below the route drawing controls)
2. The button changes to **✅ Finish** when active
3. Your cursor becomes a crosshair
4. Status text appears: "📍 Click to add points • Double-click to finish"

### Adding Measurement Points
1. Click anywhere on the map to add a point
2. A blue marker appears at each click location
3. Distance labels automatically appear between points
4. As you move your mouse, a preview line shows where the next segment will be

### Finishing a Measurement
- **Option 1**: Click the **✅ Finish** button
- **Option 2**: Double-click on the map
- The tool deactivates and shows your final measurement

### Clearing Measurements
- Click the **🧹 Clear** button to remove all measurement graphics
- This clears everything and resets the tool

## Technical Details

### Files Modified/Created

#### New File: `src/utils/measurementTool.js`
- Contains all measurement logic
- Exports: `activateMeasurementTool()`, `deactivateMeasurementTool()`, `clearMeasurement()`, `isMeasurementActive()`
- Uses ArcGIS geometry engine for accurate distance calculations

#### Modified: `src/main.js`
- Added import for measurement tool functions
- Added event handlers in `setupUI()` function
- Integrated with existing `distanceAnnotationsLayer`

#### Modified: `index.html`
- Added measurement widget section below drawing controls
- Clean UI with two buttons: Measure and Clear
- Status text area for user feedback

#### Modified: `src/style.css`
- Added `.active` class styling for buttons
- Blue highlight when measurement tool is active

### Graphics Architecture
All measurement graphics are added to the existing `distanceAnnotationsLayer`, making them:
- ✅ Compatible with layer visibility controls
- ✅ Cleanly separated from route graphics
- ✅ Easy to clear all at once
- ✅ Using the same rendering pipeline

### Graphic Types Created
1. **Point Markers** - `type: "measurement-point"`
2. **Lines** - `type: "measurement-line"` (with `temporary: true/false`)
3. **Distance Labels** - `type: "measurement-label"` (with `temporary: true/false`)
4. **Total Label** - `type: "measurement-total"`

All measurement graphics are tagged with a `type` attribute starting with `"measurement-"` for easy filtering.

## Console Logging
The tool provides helpful console feedback:
```
📏 Activating measurement tool...
✅ Measurement tool active - Click to add points
   💡 Double-click or press ESC to finish
   📍 Point 1 added at (155000.23, 463000.45)
   📏 Total distance: 45.67 m
   📍 Point 2 added at (155050.12, 463020.34)
   📏 Total distance: 120.45 m
✅ Final measurement: 120.45 m (2 points)
📏 Deactivating measurement tool...
✅ Measurement tool deactivated
```

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- **Cursor changes**: Crosshair when measuring
- **Button state**: "Measure" → "✅ Finish" with blue highlight
- **Preview line**: Dashed line follows mouse
- **Status text**: Shows current mode and instructions

### Interactive States
1. **Inactive**: Gray "📏 Measure" button
2. **Active**: Blue "✅ Finish" button
3. **Measuring**: Crosshair cursor, preview line visible
4. **Finished**: Measurements remain, tool inactive

## Integration with Existing Features

### Compatibility
- ✅ Works alongside route drawing
- ✅ Uses same graphics layer as distance annotations
- ✅ Doesn't interfere with route evaluation
- ✅ Can be used while routes are visible
- ✅ Measurements persist until cleared

### Layer Management
- Measurements appear on the `distanceAnnotationsLayer`
- They're separate from route-specific annotations
- Toggle layer visibility to show/hide measurements
- Clear button removes only measurement graphics

## Best Practices

### When to Use
- ✅ Checking distances between infrastructure elements
- ✅ Verifying spacing before drawing a route
- ✅ Quick distance checks during planning
- ✅ Comparing alternative route options

### When NOT to Use
- ❌ Don't use for permanent documentation (not saved)
- ❌ Not for EMC compliance calculations (use route evaluation instead)
- ❌ Not synchronized with route data

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Currently supported:
- **Double-click**: Finish measurement
- **ESC**: (Future enhancement - could deactivate tool)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
Possible additions if needed:
1. **Area measurement**: Click to create a polygon and calculate area
2. **Export measurements**: Save measurements to CSV/JSON
3. **Measurement history**: Keep a list of recent measurements
4. **Angle measurement**: Show angles between segments
5. **Snap to features**: Snap measurement points to infrastructure
6. **Undo last point**: Remove the last added point
7. **ESC key handler**: Cancel measurement with ESC key
